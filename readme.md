# Welcome to my ~~repo~~ portfolio

Since you're here, you're probably wondering why this site is open-source.  
Well, I am making this site as a showcase of some of my capabilities as a programmer. However, my preference is definitely focused on the backend. By this I mean cloud hosting and networking.

## Deployment Strategy

This site is CI/CD, for example. However, I have implemented this on my own end with a webhook integration—because of reasons.  
I will attempt over time to slowly make this repo more and more of a technical showcase. However, this will be done in the free time I have during my studies.

## Goals I Want to Achieve

To be completely honest, I don't really know where I want to go with this page. I was first inspired by [ytcracker](https://ytcracker.com/v2020/) and his website. But I must admit that that does not really meet the goals of my project completely.

One of my big goals here is to have a showcase of my coding skills, and making a desktop env for in the browser would be very cool, NGL. I can put my GitHub in an iframe in there and I will do some cool, unique things. But the creativity needed is not really my thing. So along the way, we’ll see where I end up. I don't think I will do anything CMS-like because, well, let's face it—securing that might be a pain. Although it’s also a fun challenge... maybe I’ll let CTFs run on it, idk.

## current task
 - make a script that gets and injects some but not all env data into a file so php can read it 

## What I Have on My TODO for This Page

- Automated testing  
- Blog-like capability  
- To be decided
