<h1>Welcome to my repo</h1>
<p>
    As you are here you're probably wondering why this site is opensource. <br>
    Well i am making this site as a showcase of some of my capabilities as a programmer, however my preference is definetly focussed on the backend. with this i mean cloud hosting and networking.

    This site is CI/CD for example, howerver i have implemented this on my own end with a webhook intergration because of reasons.
    I will attempt over time to slowly make this repo more and more of a technical showcase. however this will be done in the free time i have during my studies.
